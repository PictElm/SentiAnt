## Beginning of the game

The map consists of a grid of N by N (more than 60 by 60) in which ants evolve. Each ant occupies one square and each square has only one ant.

The nests begins with only their respective queen (fixed unit occupying two cells allowing the production of mobile units) and 8 resources. Initially, the map is fully obstructed by walls "digable" (commun underground) or not (rocks), with the exception of the areas around each queens.
